    <h1>App Bridge</h1>
    <p>
        When writing third-party integrations into Bullhorn it is helpful to have a mechanism to tie into the currently logged in users context. We achieve that with this AppBridge. With this, as a developer, you will be able to open record, execute REST calls and bind/fire custom events that will directly interact with the currently logged in user's session.
